# FitVire Web Admin - Authentication System Status

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Core Architecture Setup
- ✅ Domain-driven architecture with `/src/domains/shared` structure
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode configuration
- ✅ Zustand store without infinite loops
- ✅ React Query integration
- ✅ Glass morphism design system components

### 2. Authentication Store (authStore.ts)
- ✅ Simplified Zustand store without complex middleware 
- ✅ Secure token storage with sessionStorage
- ✅ User state management with proper typing
- ✅ Login/logout functionality
- ✅ Token expiry validation
- ✅ Activity tracking
- ✅ Error handling

### 3. Type System (auth.ts, common.ts)
- ✅ Complete User interface with role-based permissions
- ✅ AuthTokens with expiry timestamps
- ✅ Permission system with specific actions
- ✅ UserRole system (superadmin, internal_staff)
- ✅ InternalStaffTitle system for role hierarchy

### 4. UI Components
- ✅ Button component with glass morphism styling
- ✅ Input component with validation states
- ✅ GlassCard component for consistent layouts
- ✅ Spinner component for loading states
- ✅ AuthLayout for authentication pages

### 5. Authentication Pages
- ✅ LoginPage with form validation
- ✅ ForgotPasswordPage with email validation
- ✅ ResetPasswordPage with password strength validation
- ✅ All pages use React Hook Form + Zod validation

### 6. Testing & Validation
- ✅ AuthTest component to verify store functionality
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No infinite loop issues
- ✅ Proper TypeScript type checking

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS / NEEDS ATTENTION

### 1. Authentication Hooks (useAuth.ts)
- ⚠️ Complex useAuth hooks need simplification
- ⚠️ Remove unused `updateTokens` functionality
- ⚠️ Session manager needs backend integration TODOs

### 2. Services (authService.ts)
- ⚠️ Mock implementation ready for backend integration
- ⚠️ All API calls return mock data with TODO comments

## ❌ TODO - NEXT IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Backend Integration
- ❌ Connect to actual FitVire backend API endpoints
- ❌ Implement real JWT token refresh logic
- ❌ Add API error handling and retry logic
- ❌ Add CSRF protection and security headers
- ❌ Implement session persistence with secure storage

### Phase 2: Dashboard and Routing
- ❌ Create AppRouter with protected routes
- ❌ Implement role-based route access control  
- ❌ Create DashboardLayout with sidebar navigation
- ❌ Add breadcrumb navigation system
- ❌ Implement logout confirmation modal

### Phase 3: User Management Features
- ❌ User list with search and filtering
- ❌ User profile management
- ❌ Permission management interface
- ❌ Activity logging and audit trails
- ❌ Bulk user operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- ❌ Dark mode toggle implementation
- ❌ Notification system integration
- ❌ Real-time session management
- ❌ Advanced security features (2FA, device tracking)
- ❌ Performance monitoring and error tracking

## 🔧 CURRENT TECHNICAL STATE

### Working Components:
- Authentication store (simplified, no infinite loops)
- Type system with proper validation
- UI components with glass morphism design
- Basic authentication pages with form validation
- AuthTest component demonstrates working state management

### Testing Status:
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No React infinite loop errors  
- ✅ Store state management working correctly
- ✅ Component rendering without crashes

### Ready for Development:
The authentication system foundation is complete and stable. The next developer can:
1. Run the app and test authentication with AuthTest component
2. Begin backend API integration using the existing service layer
3. Implement actual dashboard routing and protected routes
4. Add real user management features

## 📝 DEVELOPER NOTES

### Store Architecture Decision:
- Removed complex Zustand middleware (persist, immer, subscribeWithSelector) to eliminate infinite loops
- Implemented manual token storage using sessionStorage for security
- Store is intentionally simplified for stability and performance

### Security Considerations:
- Tokens stored in sessionStorage (not localStorage) for better security
- JWT expiry validation implemented
- Permission-based access control ready for implementation
- TODO: Add CSRF tokens and secure headers in production

### Performance Optimizations:
- Minimal re-renders with selective Zustand subscriptions
- React Query for server state caching
- Code splitting ready with React.lazy patterns
- Bundle size optimized with proper tree shaking

### Development Environment:
- PowerShell script execution disabled (normal Windows security)
- Use `npx vite` or adjust execution policy to run dev server
- All TypeScript strict mode checks passing
- ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
